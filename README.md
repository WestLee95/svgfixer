# MorphForge

> _Where unruly SVGs become GSAP-ready masterpieces_

A sleek, dark-themed React tool that transforms messy SVG files into clean, morph-ready vectors for GSAP's MorphSVG plugin. No more wrestling with nested groups, clip paths, or dodgy definitions — just drop your SVG and watch the magic happen.

## ✨ What It Does

- **Strips the nonsense**: Removes `<defs>`, clip paths, and unnecessary attributes
- **Flattens hierarchy**: Unwraps nested groups whilst preserving transforms
- **Extracts clean paths**: Delivers pure, morphable path data
- **Instant preview**: See your cleaned SVG before you download
- **One-click workflow**: Copy to clipboard or download — your choice

## 🎨 Features

- Dark theme with turtle green accents (because dark mode is life)
- Drag-and-drop file uploads
- Real-time statistics (paths found, groups removed, file size)
- Responsive design built with React & Tailwind CSS
- Zero backend dependency — pure client-side magic

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Fire it up
npm run dev
```

Then navigate to `localhost:5173` and start forging those morphs.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React 18** with Vite
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Lucide React** for icons
- Vanilla JavaScript for SVG parsing (because sometimes simple is superior)

## 📋 Use Case

Perfect for animators, web developers, and creative technologists who work with GSAP's MorphSVG plugin. Export from Illustrator, Figma, or any design tool, then let MorphForge clean it up for seamless morphing animations.
